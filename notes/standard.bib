Some special distances, namely those associated with Kendall and Cayley, decompose into a sum of independent components under the uniform distribution. These distances lead to multiparameter generalizations whose parameters may be interpreted as information at various stages in a ranking process. Estimation of model parameters is described, and the results are applied to an example of word associations. A censoring argument motivates simple extensions of these models to include partial rankings. The generalized Cayley distance model is illustrated for random arrangements arising from mechanisms other than ranking.},

                  an important starting point for students grappling
                  with the complexities of social choice
                  theory. Rigorous yet accessible, this primer avoids
                  the use of technical language and provides an
                  up-to-date discussion of this rapidly developing
                  field. This is the first in a series of texts

	Abstract = {A Condorcet social choice function elects the candidate that beats every other candidate under simple majority when such a candidate exists. Various extensions of Condorcet's simple majority principle that deal with situations that have no simple majority winner have been proposed. Nine Condorcet social choice functions are analyzed and compared on the basis of how well they satisfy a number of conditions for social choice functions. The conditions include several generalizations of Condorcet's Principle. Remarks on the relative merits of the nine basic functions are included.},
