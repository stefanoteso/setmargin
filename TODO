Motivation:
- preference elicitation with large feature space (50-100) of boolean or continuous attributes
-> bayesian approaches too expensive
-> min-max regret assumes perfect feedback

Requirements:
max margin
satisfy preferences
diversify utilities
maximize per-utility recommendation

BOOLEAN CASE:
- cast problem as MILP 

CONTINUOUS CASE:
- non-convex -> alternated optimization

HYBRID CASE:
- alternated OMT

EXPERIMENTS:

BOOLEAN CASE:
- comparison with bayesian approaches (viappiani if appropriate and guo&sanner) for increasing number of features

CONTINUOUS CASE:
- comparison with bayesian approaches (bonilla?) for increasing number of features

HYBRID CASE:
- comparison con campigotto?

TODO:
- engineer boolean version (python?)
- implement continuous version (python)
- implement hybrid version ?
- gather competing methods
- run experiments

PB
- no theoretical guarantees
- non-linear features?

DEADLINE:
- AAAI 2016 (15 sept)
- DM and RecSys workshop (7 sept)
- IJCAI 2016 (2 feb)
